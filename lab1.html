    <h1>Aurora Borealis/Northen Lights!</h1>
    <p>The Aurora Borealis, or known as the northern lights, are beautifully displayed ribbons of light. They can usually be seen from the North pole, and are pretty cool!</p>
    <h2>How is this caused?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>According to the Michigan Tech page, the lights are caused, by "the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and charged particles from the sun's atmosphere that enter the earth's atmosphere.</li>
        <li>So, to summarize, a solar flare. Which are basically particles with energy, directly from the sun, that float in space.</li>
    
    </ol>
    <h2>So, what happened yesterday with the lights? Why was it seen clearly?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Well, this is because for the past few monthr or so, the sun had been active in the sense that it had been sending out more flares than usual</li>
        <li>According to CBS NEWS, they state, "The geomagnetic storm responsible for Thursday's stunning skies is now subsiding, CBS Boston reported."</li>
